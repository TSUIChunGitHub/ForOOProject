There are some assumption in design my system.
1:To make it easy for checking and show the OO Skill, Assume there are four type of user, It is administrator, staff, supervisor and director.
2:User can create the staff,supervisor,director in the create staff reccod function. In addition, staff must assign to one supervisor
before create the staff record. Moreover, Due to the requirement methion that only 1 director in system. So ,When user create the director type user to system. The system will check whether contain the director in the system.
If already contain the director type user, the system will not create the relevant record.
3:The System only contain one director, and director cannot manage by any user. (Point 3) in the project description)
4:Director will automatically manage all staff.
5:For the leave request, To make it easy, Assume one user only can create one leave record.
6:When staff make the leave request, the request will be pass to her/his supervisor. if supervisor decline the request. 
Then the request will not pass to director. If the request have approve by supervisor, it will pass to director for futher consider.
And the director will not see the leave request when the request not approve by supervisor
7:When superviosor make the request, the request will be pass to director directly for further consider.

In order to make the demo more smooth. There are some user account are already init in the system.
User:chuntsui Password:1  Type:Administrator
User:peterwong Password:1 Type:Staff
User:marywong Password:1 Type:Staff
User:lalachan Password:1 Type:Staff
User:benchan Password:1 Type:Supervisor Manage Staff:peterwong,marywong,lalachan
User:fishlung Password:1 Type:Supervisor
User:helenchoi Password:1 Type:Supertvisor
User:bosschan Password:1 Type:Director Manage:All Staff

Where handle the function?
1.) Create Record Page, Delete Record Page.
2.) Create Record Page(When user create the staff type user. It must be assign to one supervisor before create the record)
3.) Create Record Page(User can create the director type user. But the system will check the only contain one director type user record)
And Assign Staff Page (The System will keepstrack user not able to assign direcor type user for manage)
4.) Assign Staff Page (User can assign staff type user type to other staff type user for manage and keepstack user cannot manage by many supervisor)
5.) Maintain Leave Page
